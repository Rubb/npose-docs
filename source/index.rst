Welcome to nPose's documentation!
=================================

nPose is a system for controlling avatar animations in Second Life objects.
Most commonly these objects are chairs, couches, or beds, but they could also be
skateboards, airplanes, or witches' brooms.

While easy to set up, nPose also provides a very flexible framework for plugging
in custom behavior for practically any scenario.  By using existing plugins, or
writing your own, you can integrate nPose into vehicles, traps, and scenes that
fill an entire Second Life sim.
